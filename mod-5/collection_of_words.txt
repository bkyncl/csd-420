The mass media serve as a system for communicating messages and symbols to the general populace. It
is their function to amuse, entertain, and inform, and to inculcate individuals with the values, beliefs,
and codes of behavior that will integrate them into the institutional structures of the larger society. In a
world of concentrated wealth and major conflicts of class interest, to fulfill this role requires
systematic propaganda.
In countries where the levers of power are in the hands of a state bureaucracy, the monopolistic
control over the media, often supplemented by official censorship, makes it clear that the media serve
the ends of a dominant elite. It is much more difficult to see a propaganda system at work where the
media are private and formal censorship is absent. This is especially true where the media actively
compete, periodically attack and expose corporate and governmental malfeasance, and aggressively
portray themselves as spokesmen for free speech and the general community interest. What is not
evident and remains undiscussed in the media is the limited nature of such critiques, as well as the
huge inequality in command of resources, and its effect both on access to a private media system and
on its behavior and performance.
A propaganda model focuses on this inequality of wealth and power and its multilevel effects on
mass-media interests and choices. It traces the routes by which money and power are able to filter out
the news fit to print, marginalize dissent, and allow the government and dominant private interests to
get their messages across to the public. The essential ingredients of our propaganda model, or set of
news "filters," fall under the following headings: (1) the size, concentrated ownership, owner wealth,
and profit orientation of the dominant mass-media firms; (2) advertising as the primary income source
of the mass media; (3) the reliance of the media on information provided by government, business, and
"experts" funded and approved by these primary sources and agents of power; (4) "flak" as a means
of disciplining the media; and (5) "anticommunism" as a national religion and control mechanism.
These elements interact with and reinforce one another. The raw material of news must pass through
successive filters, leaving only the cleansed residue fit to print. They fix the premises of discourse and
interpretation, and the definition of what is newsworthy in the first place, and they explain the basis
and operations of what amount to propaganda campaigns.
The elite domination of the media and marginalization of dissidents that results from the operation of
these filters occurs so naturally that media news people, frequently operating with complete integrity
and goodwill, are able to convince themselves that they choose and interpret the news "objectively"
and on the basis of professional news values. Within the limits of the filter constraints they often are
objective; the constraints are so powerful, and are built into the system in such a fundamental way,
that alternative bases of news choices are hardly imaginable. In assessing the newsworthiness of the
U.S. government's urgent claims of a shipment of MIGs to Nicaragua on November 5, I984, the media
do not stop to ponder the bias that is inherent in the priority assigned to government-supplied raw
material, or the possibility that the government might be manipulating the news, imposing its own
agenda, and deliberately diverting attention from other material. It requires a macro, alongside a
micro- (story-by-story), view of media operations, to see the pattern of manipulation and systematic
bias.
